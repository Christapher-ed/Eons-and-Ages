# Zekrimabu Anchors
The two Titans having finished their respective campuses mostly destroyed or submitted, the Zekribandu swallowed the snarls of Witherbloom, and Prismari, and with a pained cry began to settle down, and instead of lashing out curl up and cry.

Once the Zekribandu "shut down" the beasts, by pulling levers in their brain shutting down the movement related parts of the monsters slowly. Then the controllers ramp up the [[morta potentia manipulation things]] sending crackling through the whole plane, transforming it into hell, transforming the elements themselves, Earth->Brimstone, Water->Styxwater, Fire->Hellfire, Air->Sulfuric Air 

Members from the Akmenos Campus, and Nastros Campus help maintain and study the the beasts building labs, shrines, generators, all across the region
