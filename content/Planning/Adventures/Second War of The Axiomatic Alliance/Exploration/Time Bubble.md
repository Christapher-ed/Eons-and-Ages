"Save points"- where the party can long rest in a bubble outside time as a battle from long ago plays out in front of them.

Chai will open them with his time powers, everyone else will bounce off of them, and maybe feel a slight shock

Chai can go through, and for a brief period, walk inside the coil but only to the first loop (first age) for the first time bubble

From the inside Chai will be able to lift the bubble like Gamera in that one movie

Party will be able to interact with the people in there, but not go far, and have no lasting effect on the world, only really ask questions.

Show each Age change, and at the very end (when chai uses his wish) show death rebirth from Tiny Tempus' perspective everything the same, except w/e Chai wishes up to where they would be in the current era 

Maybe show/explain the cycles through this and how if the devils when the cycle will break cause Law won twice in a row, they rule forever


### Pael
Pael will be able to absorb something from seeing these, some instinct that this is knowledge that needs to be preserved
Pael will see what everyone else see's through one eye, and something else in the other, (xandrils timeline), and a third more mysterious one with both eyes closed.
Pael (or someone else if Pael tells them) will be able to make a DC:15 Arcana check to tell its because of Xandrils soul
Pael will be able to make a DC:20 history or religion check (adv if last check passed) to tell that this is from a previous timeline, Xandrils


# Time Bubble one
![[Chaiwalk1.png]]
[[First Treaty of Moragitzu-Kesh]] for everyone else

Will see Cupriel disquised as leader of church of the cycle, and Pre corruption Urur ethereally hovering around The [[High Priestess of Urur]] , show church of the cycle acolytes carving the prophecies found under the hall of oracles, 

[[First Betrayal of The Eon of Betrayals]] for Pael



# Time Bubble Two

[[first battle of the blood age]] for everyone else
Tiny Tempus is at this one, distraught. Urur as the party knows him wrecking things
Tiny maybe meets Nastros and Hobroy

[[Second Betrayal of The Eon of Betrayals]] for Pael

# Time Bubble Three

Happens as soon as chai touches the tempus blade.

[[War of the axiomatic alliance]] for everyone else but in some new sort of light

Show tiny tempus using the world engine in mechanus for something changing time? Making himself an archfey?
Maybe put the manalock on the snarl 

the energy from the manalock has to go somewhere, Tiny initially sent it to Elder dragons at the behest of the devil cupriel, The World Engine itself suggests, giving the devils the power,
it would cause immediate suffering but based on the world engines simulations be the least likely to end space time, and the Dragon timeline is 100% likely to end in Timeline fracture 

Activates [[Chais wish]]

[[First Treaty of The Eon of Concilliation]] for Pael

Shows Pael what he'll have to do, what
