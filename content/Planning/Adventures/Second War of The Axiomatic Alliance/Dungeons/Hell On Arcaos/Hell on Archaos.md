Play- Hell On Arcaos Playlist

	 "There is no good and evil, only greater and lesser evils" - Weltrin Maggotmaster on Cosmological Forces

Every second of this age, maybe longer. has built to this Since the Snarl was locked away at the end of the last there were always two possibilities with [[The Manalock]]: It would last forever or something, someone would manipulate it. The Oriq, along with The Ball Brigade, made sure it was the latter. Now Elarion gave his souls as the last ingredient, the well from the hall of oracles crumbling behind him. The ground is shaking and the roof doesn't seem like it'll last, there's only one exit into the cavernous underdark, and from there you only know the way up through Pillar Drop.

Are you ready for  Hell on Arcaos?

## Hell On Arcaos
### Collapsing Caverns
The Exit to the cave, will crumble behind them blocking off the Mana Lock, the bridge to pillar drop will crumble when they get close, a distant booming of Draconic voices, and pained screams, can lead the party to a cave.

Draconic speakers DC 15 perception check to hear, "What is the meaning of this Fiends?"

The Party will go through the tunnels:
- in initiative order
- imps ambushing
- roll d20 for rocks to fall at the end of every turn fall on 19 or 18 or20 random of the layer they're on falls, all of layer fall per round.
- Dark brassy pods full of Lemures and Styxwater teleported underground  

Scare the party when they're split up and alone, spooky hell noises everythings piss colored and fart smelled
let some rp roll out when they get to the end, split up but still a path to follow till they start seeing light, until they see the school in hellfire


### A different surface

Play both songs in - Dirtymyuckyshell Playlist

near dirty mc yuckys the party comes out of some hills and see: 

- Piss yellow sky
- Biblioplex surrounded by devil ships and a towering wall 
- whole city being invaded, every campus 
- 2 [[Akmenos Morta Potentia Experiments|Zekrimabu]] the size of cities themselves annihilating the Prismari and Witherbloom Campuses.
- Elder Dragons flying around near the top of the islands, where the all the snarls are being siphoned, and something above all that is...dripping
- Dirty Mc'Yuckys is one of the few untouched places, the devils didn't seem to think a stinky old bar mattered

DC 15 Arcana check to notice there are two distinct eye shaped portals in the sky, an opened Daemostar, and Archostar, portals to Cthon (17 or highter: plane of Blood) and a very familiar part of Baator

## Battle of Dirty Mc Yuckys
### Reunions

The Party will get to Dirty Mc' Yuckys where the people are putting up a makeshift resistance (The Partys allies, and behind the party now probably their Oriq cultists who they now lead) Party may get a short respite in conversing with their reunited companions.

Dirty Mc Yuckys will have everyone, even the remnants of Rosies Blood Cult

Give Darren [[Irwin info]]

Irwin, or another Cycle Society member will try to convince the party they're the only ones who can do anything about this, and how Chai needs to get the tempus blade, and get to the central snarl, because if Chai doesen't destroy the school, Devils rule all worlds forever, or reality falls 

One of [[Nastros]]' seer devils will see the party and let out a loud toot alerting devils in the area. Maybe led by Maeve clones

### Run
Play- Run Playlist

An overwhelming amount of Devils will appear, led by Manslaughter Maeve who will drop through the roof with [[Akmenos Morta Potentia Experiments|7 other Zekribandu and 2 Zekribandu Esoterica]], and scatter the newly minted resistance

Cadoras, or another senior Oriq member will tell the party, theres Oriq, and Magehunter sleeper cells on all 6 campuses but only Elarion knew how to activate them. After awhile he'll say he knows how to summon the only other "thing" that could, 
### What Price for Victory?
Ur-Abzu, and two others will appear and offer a pact to the new leaders of his mortal Allies in exchange for the pain of one party member, to feed a [[Larval Daemogoth]] the Larvae will allow the user to communicate basic ideas to allies, nothing too complex and any information received or sent will be unconscious basically makes you in sync with your armies (aka unlocks mass combat rules)  (will only hurt (1d4 piercing 1d4 psychic) to install, after any pain you would feel goes to the Larval Daemogoth)

Sort of a Psychic Starfish with one appendage longer than the others the parastic Larval Daemogoth named "Ur-, will have to attach to mortals body, preferably one tendril between the thumb and pointer finger, one under the thumb, one between the pinky and index finger, one around the pinky on the outside, and the long twice around the wrist then buried into the wrist. It'll shoot spores in the air to get overviews of the battlefield, communicate to allies, and convey battlefield info through injecting chemicals into the host

Daemogoths will make pact by consecutive hands coming out of their chest one, till a vaguely human one comes out

Effectively Gives: Advantage on Con saves, Morale of Troops and Allied Troops plus one in mass combat, Learn Abyssal

If connected the pain begins to subside, and the Larval Daemogoth will say in the players mind, "You feel? Thank you! I was so hungry!" and will introduce itself as "Ur-Namus" which the character will somehow instinctively know is Abyssal for "Beginning of the end"

## Siege of The Biblioplex
### Gather
One way or another the party and their allies, will reconvene  near the Brimstone Gate and prepare to attack.
if they refuse the Larval Daemogoth Ur-Abzu will still awaken the sleeper cells.
Bolstered by the sleeper cells, the party will be able to get into the gate.

Let Party choose elite troop, to follow them alongside Bongo

### Battle of The Hell Gate
Party will run into some students/teachers with brimstone through their chests along with Hellish Detentees that will fight the party, saying things, like, "its them" "they'll ruin all that's been built," 
Nixon comes out round 2, very meddling kids energy/recognizes party as going to destroy the world ( Nastros showed him) "Nastros showed me what you meddling kids would do to this beautiful academy, I wont let you"
teleport behind The Hell Gate at half health, and the party/ their army will have to siege down the gate, if the gates taken out before Nixons half health Nixon runs in then

## Tricky Dick
### Biblioplex
Play- Biblioplex Theme

Shrines to Buriel that fell out of the sky through the roof, surrounded by desperate students praying for mercy. 
Areas that used to be gardens have pods, with drills at the bottom that fell through the roof, each has a syxian spawning pools inside, and the tools necessary, for Buriels priests to turn the Lemures that come out of it into lesser devils, and Hellish Detentees

### Fight
Oracle of Strixhaven fight, beneath the Snarl, the destroyed dome at the center giving a view of the islands and ships blotting out the sky centered around one island with a pillar, the Deans, and Elder Dragons meeting around it, orbitting a now massive snarl with Elarion at the
center as a crown of sorcerous families.

Starts by allowing Retrath and some CEC students impale him in the chest with brimstone Arcane infused by the "Snarl Reborn" with a "bright yellow sulfur crystal energy" in front of one of several shrines to Buriel that fell from the sky

Play- Nixon Theme

"The seat of reality, a new throne for hell I see it now. Nastros was right, I was The Oracle but I was blind," Arcane energy crackles out of him and through the Biblioplex hardening to brimstone and striking a student who was praying to the elder dragons

"Hail Buriel, an Archdevil worthy of the honor, may the cycle of eons break"

Xp Budget 9100xp-11900xp
1-Maybe very reskinned Ice devil with wall of brimstone instead -11500
2-Summoned Brimstone Elementals -400

Near end (for one turn):

1-Brimstone Elemental Nixon (reskinned cradle of Stone Scion)



### The Way Forward
When Defeated Oracle Nixon will stumble, and fall into what used to be The Snarl which is now the rubble holding up the already caving floor, and explode into a gargantuan Brimstone elemental, and swipe a bit at the party then hardening his head filling the hall of oracles, one arm in front of the party, one arm reaching through the roof, giving a way up.

## Brief Respite
### Time Bubble
Somewhere on the roof the party will run into a Time Bubble to 1st Age Kesh, anyone but Chai will bounce off of it Chai will be able to go through like its a liquid.
When he goes through he sees the [[Eonic Coil]] but can only from where he is to the end of the first loop (first age) in First Age Kesh, they are at the top of the fortress library of Kesh
![[Chaiwalk1.png]]
From the inside Chai will be able to lift the bubble like Gamera in that one movie to let the rest of the party in
### The Fortress Library of Kesh
Will see Cupriel disguised as leader of church of the cycle, and Pre corruption Urur ethereally hovering around The [[High Priestess of Urur]] , show church of the cycle acolytes carving the prophecies found under the hall of oracles
## Post Mortem
Pael and Xenu splashed with  Styx water
Party split in the caves between Xenu & Meepo, Pael & Hela, and Maeve, Bryan'del, & Chai
Maeve confronted Manslaughter called them dogs
Hela took Larval Daemagoth
