W/e Chais wish, its enacted via rewinding. back to the first birth (possibly leaving that timeline doomed lol) then back forwards, stopping so Chai can change what he needs as the true [[Tempus Blade]]. 

The Devils have been working towards this for ages, and theres plenty of traps Chai could fall in that may actually aid them

Show tiny tempus using the world engine in mechanus for something changing time? Making himself an archfey?
Maybe put the manalock on the snarl 

the energy from the manalock has to go somewhere, Tiny initially sent it to Elder dragons at the behest of the devil cupriel, The World Engine itself suggests, giving the devils the power,
it would cause immediate suffering but based on the world engines simulations be the least likely to end space time, and the Dragon timeline is 100% likely to end in Timeline fracture 


Chai may change
