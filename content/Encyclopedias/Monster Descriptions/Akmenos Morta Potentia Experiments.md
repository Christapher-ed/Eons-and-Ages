[[Akmenos]] uses names in Infernal, Arcavian Common (in literal and less literal translations), and Mechanus notation

- Mechanus notation- a form of name based on purely identification purposes, chiefly used by Modrons and Innevitables. Many mages, and scientists across all planes, even those directly opposed to the goals of Mechanus find it useful.

the first 2 letters first letter being the type of monster/experiment, second being iteration of that type.

M- being creatures related to his [[Morta Potentia]] experiments

in the [[Morta Potentia]] experiments there's modifications on that after, then Legion and rank in in that legion

# The "A series" (Zekribandu)
Also called Zekri[bandu](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#seskari=cnano&sisku=bandu&bangu=en&versio=masno) or Singuard. starting w/ Maeve attempting to create cambions/tieflings that could manipulate [[Morta Potentia]] and used to make its conform to Akmenoses will. Had early success with [[Morta Potentia]] manipulation but, severe loyalty issues making the earliest versions worthless, and while later ones where undyingly loyal, they mostly lack [[Morta Potentia]], and completely lack [[Immorta Permena]]. Make good elite soldiers/guards.

 implanted with as close to Maeves mind and memories as possible and kept in submission through the constant torment of Simulacra of Maeves family members and loved ones, by a crew of devils experienced in manipulation


# The "B through T Series" 

While the A series found other purposes, B through T were complete failures or mere tests for specific things. a lot of jars of flesh whose only purpose is to experiment with new organs, or maintaining [[Morta Potentia]] without decay, or horrifying hommunculi of different mortals, animals, and devils.

- Zekri[menli](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#seskari=cnano&sisku=menli&bangu=en&versio=masno) | Sinmind | Mind Maeve | MM-a-N/A-1 through 3
Basically a giant brain, was intitially meant to be a sort of biological super computer, but any beast that [[Akmenos]] put it in used it all for the operation of its body. Hollowing out the body, and letting it be operated by internal devils let it use more power, and grafting a MA1-b Zekrimandu
# The "U or Ultimate Series" (Zekrimabu) 

Also called Zekrimabu or Sinbeasts. Currently only 2 exist, hidden from even the rest of the Triumvirate of [[Buriel]]. Mostly made up of parts of huge monsters captured by his legions via infiltrating other planes. The parts are linked and supported by Hellfire Engine Machinery

Due to the Purely Lawful Evil [[Morta Potentia]], mixed with infernal blood and hellfire engines, super charges the area around them, the culmination of Millenia of experimentation.

the two beasts are controlled through by a MA1-b Zekribandu grafted to, a MM-a Zekrimenli

Until Maeve challenged him [[Akmenos]] had no idea how he could make something both controllable but still have enough [[Morta Potentia]] to be useful, he figured he could get Maeve to Submit, if only he had huge mobile facilities dedicated to her constant torment, and he has one to attatch the original to.

Powers also been solved via, something simmilar to Meepos artificial Dragon Heart, except they can swallow an entire Snarl. Designed by Retrath, culmination of his own experiments, on his own blood and the blood of other Dragonkin.

## Zekrimabu names:

- [Munje](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#seskari=cnano&sisku=munje&bangu=en&versio=masno)[dapma](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#seskari=cnano&sisku=dapma&bangu=en&versio=masno) | Universe Damner | MU-a-1ZM-1000

Looks more like bug like Typhon of Greek Mythology, thousand heads, various degrees between a female Tiefling and a dragon, but body still made up mainly of Tarrasque, Astral Dreadnaught, and some sort of giant Hellfly parts particularly wings.

- [Mujyku'e](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#seskari=cnano&sisku=mujyku%2527e&bangu=en&versio=masno)[gunta](https://la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/index.html#seskari=cnano&sisku=gunta&bangu=en&versio=masno) | Universal Invader | MU-b-2ZM-1000

Looks more Tarrasque like (medieval) Big turtle shell, but screaming faces of gnomes and dogs beneath the skin cover most of the visible flesh

- name

Third one, has no brain, is awaiting a MA1 zekribandu
