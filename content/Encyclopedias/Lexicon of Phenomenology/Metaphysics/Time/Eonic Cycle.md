An Eon is a cycle of epic poetry that makes up the infinite poem of the Eonic Cycle comparable to the [[Eonic Coil]]
# Mythic-Poetic Structure
(Elemental Planes always existed)

Eons are 5 line poems about duality where the rhymes are the recurring action at the end of each age. 
A= The action that ended the last eon
B= The one that will end the current one
so all poems must start with a and end with b
and there must always be more of the rhyming action associated with that Eon

# 1: Eon of Marriage (The Midnight Queens Cycle) Marriage -> Betrayal
Perception: as it is 
Memory: as it was
**Rhyme Scheme:**

Age 1 **Perception**

**A**-Marriage | Perception->**Memory**


Age 2 **Memory**

**B**-Betrayal | **Perception**<-Memory


Age 3 **Perception**

**B**-Betrayal | Perception->**Memory**


Age 4 **Memory**

**A**-Marriage | **Perception**<-Memory


Age 5 **Perception**

**B**-Betrayal | Perception->**Memory**

Synthesis: Life

# 2: [[Eon  of Betrayal]] (The Revanchists Cycle) Betrayal -> Conciliation
**Rhyme Scheme:**

Age 1 **Death**

**A**-Betrayal | Death->**Life**

Age 2 **Life**

**B**-Conciliation |**Death**<-Life

Age 3 **Death**

**A**-Betrayal | Death->**Life**

Age 4 **Life**

**B**-Conciliation | **Death**<-Life

Age 5 **Death**

**B**-Concilliation | Death->**Life**

Synthesis: Mortality

# 3: [[Eon of Conciliation|Eon of Concilliation]] (The Executioners Cycle) Conciliation -> Conflict

If the devils can trick the planes into believing this cycle is about Law & Chaos they can position themselves as the best enforcers of that Law use the metaphysical metaphors to break the pattern of change and institute Order forever "The Seat of Reality a new throne for hell" Also helps convince mortals when the actual conflicts are about Mortality vs Immortality, lock themselves in as the lawful immortal rulers of all of time and space

False (?) Rhyme Scheme without midnight age:

Age 1 Dawn Age **Law 

**A**-Conciliation |  Law->**Chaos**

Age 2 Blood Age **Chaos

**B**-Conflict |  **Law**<-Chaos

Age 3 Mythic Age **Law**

**B**-Conflict |  Law->**Chaos**

**A**-Conciliation |  **Law**<-Chaos

**B**-Conflict | Law->**Chaos**
