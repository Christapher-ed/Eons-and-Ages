A Layer of a coil with 5 coils within it connected to the next coil by tape

(Elemental Planes always existed)

Eons are 5 line poems about duality where the rhymes are the recurring action at the end of each age. 
A= The action that ended the last eon
B= The one that will end the current one
so all poems must start with a and end with b
and there must always be more of the rhyming action associated with that Eon

# Eons minus infinity
# 1: Eon of Marriage (The Raven Cycle) Marriage -> Betrayal

## Perception vs Memory
[[The Sun King]], and Eladrin are Perception

[[Raven Queen]], and Shadar-Kai are Memory. 



Shadar-Kai, and Eladrin at the time weren't quite as they would be in later eons, all sorts of shapes and sizes, that would become fey and shadows, and none would die a natural death, which caused issues on the material plane.

Created the shadowfell, and feywild as the first planes outside the material

The Raven Queen and Shadar-Kai go on to be what causes you to see your life flash before your eyes before you die, and judge your life
## Eras
### 1 Marriage of The Sun King

Raven Queen married Sun King, they have the princes of seasons as kids
### 2 Betrayal of The Sun King

Raven Queen, and Sun King argue the nature of the universe, memories, and death. When asked whether death was over all good or bad, The Raven Queen said, "How can you remember something if it never ends?" when her husband The Sun King said, "I would never let my people die to serve your fascination with memories," she struck him so hard, that his memory was erased from time except to that of his children, and no sun would light the rest of the Eon
### 3 Betrayal of The Raven Queen
The Queen thought all had forgotten her husband, even their own children, but the princes of seasons had not, and were able to keep it from their mother till they could organize a plan. Leading to them usurping their mother, and ruling all of their parents kingdom
### 4 Marriage of second husband

The Raven Queen, now destitute, but alive gathered her most loyal followers, performing rituals that rended her own mind asunder to create a replica of both her former husband the sun king, now the night king. The two would have one child: the crow queen together. The Raven Queen would use this Shadow of her husband and his kingdom to take back her old one from her petulent children.
### 5 Betrayal of second husband

Once her lands were reconquered, and The Night King asked his queen, "what next?" she only said, "The End" and like a knife went through his throught he collapsed. with this ushering in the end of the eon. The Raven Queen split the realm between her and her children, giving them what would become the Feywild, and creating for herself the shadowfell. Shadar-Kai/Shadows and Eladrin/Fey flee to the adjacent between eons

Something Filled the role of [[Urur]] as Antithesis, and Thesis and become Synthesis, the next plane, with the next as its [[First Birth]]

How did Void and light, become shadow, and fey. How did the [[Raven Queen]] save memories?
# 2: [[Eon  of Betrayal]] (The Revanchest Cycle) Betrayal -> Conciliation


Eon that the beings of the outer planes originate from, but how?

Something Filled the role of [[Urur]] as Antithesis, and Thesis and become Synthesis, the next plane with [[Urur]] as its [[First Birth]]

How did Life, and Death become good and evil? How did Xandril fulfill his role.
