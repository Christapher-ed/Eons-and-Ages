Aka Elemental Life/Arcane magic, or "Mana" 


Often represented by love/symbols for love or "heart" but its more accurately described as capacity for love 

The ability for a mortal to grow and change, become something new, or make a willing decision to remain the same instead.

Devils, Angels, All [[Outsiders]], Except for some from the adjacent planes, though they only ever follow their own rules, are tied to the realm they come from, making it incredibly difficult if not impossible to change their, core being in the same way mortals can.



Necromancers have a strange relationship to Morta Potentia, many have a Zen attitude towards reality believing there is a certain balance between life and death that Necromancy should only be used to maintain the balance of life, and death.

Necromancers that don't dedicate themselves to this balance risk damage to the cycle of life and death, as well as likely madness, and addiction to power.

Either way Necromancers view themselves as manipulation of Morta Potentia at its peak, superior to not only basic Arcane manipulation of it, but sorcerous, druidic, etc.
