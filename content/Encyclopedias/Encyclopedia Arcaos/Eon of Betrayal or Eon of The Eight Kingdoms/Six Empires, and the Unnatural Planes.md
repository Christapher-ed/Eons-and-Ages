## The Unnatural Planes

### Mechanus
Artificially created to maintain the rest of the outer planes along with its corresponding fundamental force
Has [[the world engine]] a tool that can use the energy between Mechanus & Limbo, and the two planes duality to create new [[Fundamental Forces]] and use those forces to make new outer planes. 
### Limbo
Created as a byproduct of the creation of Mechanus along with its corresponding fundamental force

The Six Kingdoms finalized the outer realms with [[The Treaty of The Six Empires]] 

# Creation of The Outer Planes
The Six Kingdoms were the most powerful Kingdoms of the Second Eon, all of which would go on to escape the cycle of life and death, by creating the outer planes.

The first two of the Six Empires would be headed by followers of Archay, and Orphiq, despite wishing their followers would accept death as they do life, the twin gods would adhere to their followers desires.

The Followers of Archay would create Hades, with the existing force of Cessation, to protect and memorialize their souls.

The Followers of Orphiq would create Elysium, with the existing force of Conception, to preserve the fact they did live.

The  Six Empires collectively built the artificial Mechanus, and its associated artificial Fundamental Force of Law to run the rest of the Outer Planes, One of the Kingdoms taking it on as their role, to maintain it until it would become self sustaining.  
When Mechanus was created, It left a hole in reality that would become Limbo, and around the same time, another kingdom disappeared from the material plane to the new Limbo
