Pael is from the Shadowfell, where he came from a moderately normal family. out of 4 siblings, he was never close with any of them except for his brother. after awhile of study there, he decided to move to a bigger school to study plants and necromancy at a place with more diverse plants such as this school. 

He aims to study the effective uses of plants and their ability to grow on different planes to support cultures that lack necessities based on plants. He's hard to open up, but is genuine. He looks constantly goth and edgy with pale skin and dark eyes and hair. He is 43 years old, so still very young in Shadar-kai years.
