- A refugee from the hells probably. She doesn't remember much from that time. Her and her dog Grommit were found on the streets by a very nice gnome family at the age of 5. She's lived a very comfortable life since. 
- She was the tallest in her village. Sometimes she misses her small bed.
- Death terrifies her. She wants to be surrounded by the people she loves forever.
