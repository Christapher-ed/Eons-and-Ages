Chai Tempus is a Fairy belonging to the esteemed Tempus family who are noted for having assisted the Modrons long ago during a crisis and in return they enhanced the already inherent magic of the Tempus bloodline allowing them to tap into the powers of the Modrons.

Chai has a largely carefree attitude and doesn’t seem to hold the same values as the rest of his family who take their roles as orderly guardians quite seriously. After an incident where Chai carelessly trashed a nobleman's manor he was supposed to be watching, the Tempus family sent Chai off to Strixhaven in hopes that he could better control his magic and try to learn some responsibility so that when the time comes he can be a proper leader.
