Human, middle aged, male, 5' 8" Bard, Silverquill  
Arrogant, secretive, manipulative, lacks foresight on most things  
  
R. Gus Engram used to be an aspiring musician until after just 2 years of bumming various taverns and public churches, he moved on to "Spiritual Enlightenment"; for whatever that means, as anytime someone associates Engram's spirituality to known forms, like for instance Druids and Warlocks, he claims that it's some different and more "subtle" spirituality. He's already been booted out of some councils of spirit quacks.  
He has an inflated sense of self worth, and always knows more than someone else. Always. It's difficult to get him to answer questions directly, more he talks around the question somehow.  
He settled down and began living a double life as a fail safe incase his dreams of leading a cult never came to fruition. When he isn't traveling he is at home with a his Wife and kids, acting like a normal joe shmoe.  
Wants: total control(Doesn't know what to do with it),Â   
  
Has been keeping journals rituals and spiritual connections to Zenu. Working on a manifesto.  
  
Handing out fliers during free time in out in the court yard, and wherever he doesn't get booted out of.
