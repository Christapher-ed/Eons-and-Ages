# Major Realms
## Dragon Realms

Strixhaven used to be predominantly dragons and outside the Academy it still is. Both Draconic and non-Draconic follow Dragon Cult religions centering veneration to varying degrees around the elder dragons (and forces they represent) are popular. Outside the School, most of the Dragon Realms are ruled by autonomous Vassal States, Usually Dragonspawn tribes or smaller Magocracies.

## Neo-Orcish Empire

Primarily on the spooky distant southern continent that Magehunters, and Daemogoths are from, but has colonies and vassal states on the Northern one. Descended from the Xandril, Golwanda alliance,and through Golwanda The [[Thunder King]] that lost at the end of the Blood Age. Worship is spread across a pantheon of hero warrior gods: Thunder King, Urur, and Xandril maintaining a pseudo Ravenqueen memory focused religion. Capital is a series of Nomadic camps centered around an ancient Palace complex said to have been built over one of the [[Thunder King]]s old camps.

## Kingdom of Albafrankecia

A collection of disparate Princedoms, Petty Kingdoms, groups of questing nights, mad solitary Wizards, and Circles of Druids, all nominally loyal to one High King, and his Knights: [[The Nine Worthies]].

# Minor Realms

## Septean Colonies

Septea has a presence, while the church/nation don't have much military power, [[The United Guilds]] particularly the [[The Cartographers Guild]]  operate and maintain several trade ports to import the massive amounts of fresh water required to Quench their large and ever growing cities. The [[The League of the Wooded Cove]] has several logging colonies across Arcaos since the invention of [[The Elemental Shift Engine]] in 3E 5A 2.

# Groups of City States
## Dwarf Mountainhomes

extremely industrial, some of the most advanced magitech, but leans more towards magical stonework, including massive stone trains with gates used to travel to Inundatia through the Plane of Earth, other than a few between mountainholds, them and the knowledge of how to make them were lost when Inundatia flooded. Split from their Blood worshiping cousins early in the dawning age. Recently began making contact again with the Valley Dwarves but their differences cause much friction.

## Valley Dwarf Ziggurats

In Valleys, and as deep as they dare go, Ur-Dwarves worship Ur-ur the manifestation of spilt life force. Maintain, and take great pride in the fact that they maintain the old ways their cousins abandoned. Recently began making contact again with the Mountain Dwarves but their differences cause much friction.
