Worship is spread across a pantheon of hero warrior gods: Thunder King, Urur, and Xandril maintaining a pseudo Ravenqueen memory focused religion. Capital is a series of Nomadic camps centered around an ancient Palace complex said to have been built over one of the [[Thunder King]]s old camps.

## Dwarf Mountainhomes

extremely industrial, some of the most advanced magitech, but leans more towards magical stonework, including massive stone trains with gates used to travel to Inundatia through the Plane of Earth, other than a few between mountainholds, them and the knowledge of how to make them were lost when Inundatia flooded. Split from their Blood worshiping cousins early in the dawning age. Recently began making contact again with the Valley Dwarves but their differences cause much friction.

In Valleys, and as deep as they dare go, Ur-Dwarves worship Ur-ur the manifestation of spilt life force. Maintain, and take great pride in the fact that they maintain the old ways their cousins abandoned. Recently began making contact again with the Mountain Dwarves but their differences cause much friction.
