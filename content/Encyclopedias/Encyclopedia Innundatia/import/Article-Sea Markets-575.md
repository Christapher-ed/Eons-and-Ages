# Title: Sea Markets

Due to trade winds and currents, sometimes several trade routes will cross over each other. Because these intersections are often far from any islands, people will begin trading with other ships they see, then more will stop to trade, then more and more until theres a venerable floating city of ships. Some have lasted for centuries forming their own laws, and government charging hefty tarriffs on goods.
