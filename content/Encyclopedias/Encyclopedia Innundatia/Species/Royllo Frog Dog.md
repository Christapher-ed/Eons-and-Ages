Most of the native dinosaurs of [[Septea]] and [[Royllo]]were hunted to extinction, the Royllo Frog Dog however survived due to its relative docileness, and it's use in pest control, especially on Septean ships where they're often mascots, another more draconic breed is used by Kobolds as. The Royllo Frog Dog has a body similar to a triceritops but the size of a dog, no horns and a frog shaped but scaley head.
