The Driftwood gnomes are more terrifying anyone seabeast, 300 to almost 400 ft long behemoths of driftwood hollowed out and filled with feral cannabilistic Gnomes. These Gnomes will often use the branches to ensnare and impale ships adding to their floating fortress. They also have compost piles on the interior growing mushrooms to supplement their primarily carnivorous diet.

Old Wives tales say, if you don't eat them before they eat you, they'll never die.
