Tradition states, years before the Flood Event, the plane of water invaded the plane of earth. Expecting to lose and knowing the effect it would have on the material world escaped and made deals with the most powerful Dwarf clans, warning them of what was to come, and helping them prepare the great [[Dwarven Clan Ship]]s. To this day on said Clan Ships Dwarf, and Earth Elemental stand as equals often marrying, and having children to the point where most Dwarves are in part Earth Elemental. Many Rock Gnomes, and Humans living alongside the Dwarves before the flood event joined alongside their Dwarven neighbors, and assimilated into as much they influenced the Dwarven culture.
