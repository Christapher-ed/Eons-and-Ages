The League of the Wooded Cove is one of the more dominant members of [[The United Guilds]] having a monopoly on the worlds largest supply of wood. Using resin from [[The League of Stars]] they mint [[Septean Log Coin]]s, and are capable of exchanging them for their proper value in lumber.

includes: Loggers, specialized carpenters/minters, bankers, merchants

Many say that [[The Church of the Virtues]] opposes supposed druidic magic performed by the Guild of the Wooded Cove to increase yields, due to the divergence from Church Orthodoxy, but dare not intervene, at risk of [[The United Guilds]] getting involved.
