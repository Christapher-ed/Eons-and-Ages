Officially: The Grand Septean League of United Guilds

An alliance of guilds notorious for bickering, and conspiring against each other. The only thing they hate more than each other is non league members trying to operate in their waters, or their cities. 

They were formed in response to the [[Prince-Archbishop of Septea]]'sÂ attempt to regulate trade, riots and talk of revolution caused the Archbishop to get voted out by the council of Bishops. After a new Archbishop ascended the bishops and the leaders of each guild in the United Guilds signed an agreement legitimizing the league, giving them total legal control over trade and production, as well as a say in the general government of the nation.

The guild is split into 7 Leagues, Each city on the island of Septea is host to the Headquarters of one of the Guild Leagues. While most major cities, have at least one of each major guildhouse, some are more prominent in certain areas than others, distinguishing themselves through regional wealth, or specialty.
