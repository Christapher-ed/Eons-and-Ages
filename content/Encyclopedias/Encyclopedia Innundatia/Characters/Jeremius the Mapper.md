Jeremius the Mapper, was a sailor in the early years of [[The Prince-Archbishopric of Septea]]s expanison eventually captaining his own ship. Jeremius would go on to chart much of the area around [[Atlases/Atlas of Innundatia/The Opposing Isles]], and many of Septea's future colonies, he also made first contact with [[The Court of Hy-Brasil]],[[The Earthern Alliance]], and [[The Neo-Marcian Empire]]. After his retirement he founded [[The Cartographers Guild]], passing down his talents for generations to build on, as sea transit became more viable the guild began to include those who used the maps: diplomats, couriers, merchants, and adventurers becoming: The Guild League of Cartographers, Diplomats, Couriers, Merchants, Mercenaries, Sailors, Adventurers, and all who trot the Globe. One of the Dominant guilds in [[The United Guilds]].

As of 3E 5A 30 Jeremius is over 500 years old, interplanar travel,as well as the blessings of [[The Morrigan]] and [[The Hobroy]], have extended his life, but some must be attributed to his vigor and yearn for adventure. After his adventures in the Feywild, and other experiences with interplanar travel Jeremius made improvements to the [[Mirror Cosmology]] system, and a way to map it physically with : [[Planar Pelorus]] the earliest of which, mainly for locating elemental storms and whirlpools, and had nothing for elemental fire, earth, or air. Later, as he made improvements to his navigational tools, he worked on a way to open portals, he tested the earliest version of his [[The Elemental Shift Engine]] in a dinghy one day, it worked but it sent him to Arcaos far inland in the city of Strixhaven. Eventually becoming a professor in exchange to access to research material. After [[H Day]] Jeremius researched Planar Spelljammer wrecks, only able to go between their home plane and the material, he was able to use their limited ability to choose where they end up (mostly not teleporting into solid stone, or the middle of the sky without a spelljammer) to perfect the [[The Elemental Shift Engine]].
