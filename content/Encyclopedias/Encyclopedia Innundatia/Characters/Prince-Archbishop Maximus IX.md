Maximus IX is the current [[Prince-Archbishop of Septea]] the youngest ever and power hungry to boot. Has soured relations with [[The United Guilds]] by allowing monasteries to sell goods they produce breaking long established guild monopolies. He has also agitated foreigners, and supporters of religious freedom by requiring tests on [[Church of the Virtues]] theology.
