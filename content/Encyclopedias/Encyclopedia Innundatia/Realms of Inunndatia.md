# Major Realms
## [[The Prince-Archbishopric of Septea]]

The Government of the Isle of [[Septea]] founded after the Great Flood by the Seven Pilgrims, also religious leaders of [[The Church of the Virtues]] the primary religion of [[Septea]] , each of its famed seven cities being claiming a different member of [[The Virtues]] as a patron, and hosting their Cathedral there, with the Grand Church of the Seven acting as the religious capital.

### [[The United Guilds]]

Officially: The Grand Septean League of United Guilds

An alliance of guilds notorious for bickering, and conspiring against each other. The only thing they hate more than each other is non league members trying to operate in their waters, or their cities. They were formed in response to the [[Prince-Archbishop of Septea]]'s attempt to regulate trade, riots and talk of revolution caused the Archbishop to get voted out by the council of Bishops. After a new Archbishop ascended the bishops and the leaders of each guild in the league signed an agreement legitimizing the league, giving them total legal control over trade and production, as well as a say in the general government of the nation.

## [[The Neo-Marcian Empire]]

An Empire with a shared history with [[The Prince-Archbishopric of Septea]] and a desire to conquer their lands. Formed out of remnants of [[The Marcian Empire]] in its former high mountain peaks. Militaristic, and with Devil military advisors, they will stop at nothing to restore their former glory. Led by a Diarchy of a externally focused Imperator, and a internally focused Dictator, both appointed by a Senate of noble Patriarchs of Neo-Marcia. The whole empire centered around the city of [[Neo Marcia]], on its seven islands.

## [[The Earthern Alliance]]

Tradition states, years before the Flood Event, the plane of water invaded the plane of earth. Expecting to lose and knowing the effect it would have on the material world escaped and made deals with the most powerful Dwarf clans, warning them of what was to come, and helping them prepare the great [[Dwarven Clan Ship]]s. To this day on said Clan Ships Dwarf, and Earth Elemental stand as equals often marrying, and having children to the point where most Dwarves are in part Earth Elemental. Many Rock Gnomes, and Humans living alongside the Dwarves before the flood event joined alongside their Dwarven neighbors, and assimilated into as much they influenced the Dwarven culture. Centered around a magnetic Island on Innundatias north pole named Black Rock

# Minor Realms
## Fossil Industries

Led by directors and or Obama highly technological, 

# Groups of City States

Together some as powerful as Major Realms, but not united as one nation for one way or another, share common culture, history, and have strong trade relationships, as well as rivalries with each other 

## Gnomish Water Barons

Tech Feudalist Gnomes, often warring over locations for [[Gnomish Water Purifiers]]. Groups of Baronies band together under a Chief Executive Baron to protect, and increase the productivity of their Purifiers. Formerly led by a Patent Holder in Chief, descendants of the  inventor of the Gnomish Purifiers, after the main line died out the empire split into civil wars, and still many cadet branches descended from the inventor, make plays to restore the title of Patent Holder in Chief.

## Pyramid Elves

Elves who survived the flood event, by simply continuing life in the glass Pyramids they lived beneath, abandoned most Egyptian style gods for more Lovecraftian ones. (Used to be greenhouses and make a sort of jungley region in the Pyramid, now much more tundralike). Ones on former Plateaus or high up plains, may still worship some gods of their old pantheon, and retain a more temperate, or even still tropical climate, surrounded by new reefs, and ocean shelfs. Deeper down however the lack of light drives some elves to madness, calling on things that should never be called on.
