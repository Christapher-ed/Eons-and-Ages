The Corpus Cartographa is a living document of all of the guilds knowledge, magically connected to the main Corpus in the guildhouse on Septea. While The Cartographers of the guild try their best, sometimes its info is outdated, incorrect, or wild theories. [[Bookworm]] and his team of editors work tirelessly to maintain the core Corpus, but there are small delays to other versions, and lesser guild houses only have non magic copies of the Corpus, and have to update it manually.
