Some time around the Flood Event either inciting or being incited by it, the elemental plane of water set out on a war path against all other elements. The Element of Earth went to the material plane to ally with the Dwarf Clans forming [[The Earthern Alliance]], and continue to take the fight to the Elemental plane of Water that now stretches over the planes of Earth, and Fire.
