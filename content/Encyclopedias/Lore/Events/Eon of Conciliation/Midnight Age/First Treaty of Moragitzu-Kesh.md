[[Moragitzu-Kesh]] an Alliance of two neighboring city states, that had become one, one of short stocky Urmen (Proto Dwarfs similar to chaos dwarves from Warhammer) under one of Elves descended from Shadar-Kai

A group of undead priests, came out of the swamps, nearby one of Snarls, waving a banner with the witherbloom symbol on it years before their arrival, claiming they were protectors of, "All Sacred Cycles: Mundane, and Metaphysical, Life and death, for Mortal and Plane" 

They told the Leaders of each city state, that Chaos must reign for this age, and law the next, the cycle is so. After lengthy but not hostile debate, the two decided the roles they would fill and signed a treaty, leaving the city to the chaotic Urmen, as the elves would be exiled to the clouds to await their reign.

On the last day, many of the elves went to see off their Urmannish comrades well, when their leader [[Xandril The Executioner|The Grandmaster in The Executioners mask]], reached for the [[High Priestess of Urur]], and they shared the beneath together, this was the first crack, and no one reigned.
