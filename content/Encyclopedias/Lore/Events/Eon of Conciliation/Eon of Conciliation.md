#### Planes collide

Two Mirrors Lazily spin in the void, two worlds exactly alike. 

One ruled by Priests of Archay Lawful priests, that escaped the trappings of time and space, embodiments of order for the greater good, headed by Enochius, a gentle werevulture.

Its counter, One ruled by madness, instead of achieving this state through study and meditation, they gained it through struggle and pain, they're headed by a charismatic sorcerer king at the head of an Oriqular Council.

They could always see each other, each others paradise, with the same mountains, same oceans, same leylines, same central manawell. 

Then time began, the mirrors spun faster, and faster out of control. Until they collided. Ripping each other apart, except for the Leylines, that intertwined, became one, as the elements of the plane began to settle, the mirrors no longer spinning as fast, but becoming a Disco Ball sending light in wild directions.

Priests of Archay who, wanted Immortality without being chained to Hades
Daemogoths, Followers of Orphiq who wanted to return to mortality 

#### The Elemental Moon
A small moon formed as well, order brought to the chaos of the elements. 
The Arcane Energy had lit fires across both planes, it collected and became the center of the moon. 
Rubble had stained many of the ruins, and would destroy them further if left, it collected, and wrapped around the fire along with, a small ring of Earthern debris that was forming around them,
Water, had flooded, much of inland life, it was overwhelming the land of the plane, Water was dragged by air to the forming moon, a slight water would never forgive. 
Air became the jailor to water on this plane, and together with earth its prison.

birth of UR-UR life starts. Ur-Men, Shadar Kai were inexplicably there
#### [[First Treaty of Moragitzu-Kesh]]

[[Moragitzu-Kesh]] an Alliance of two neighboring city states, that had become one, one of short stocky Urmen (Proto Dwarfs similar to chaos dwarves from Warhammer) under one of Elves descended from Shadar-Kai

A group of undead priests, came out of the swamps, nearby one of Snarls, waving a banner with the witherbloom symbol on it years before their arrival, claiming they were protectors of, "All Sacred Cycles: Mundane, and Metaphysical, Life and death, for Mortal and Plane" 

They told the Leaders of each city state, that Chaos must reign for this age, and law the next, the cycle is so. After lengthy but not hostile debate, the two decided the roles they would fill and signed a treaty, leaving the city to the chaotic Urmen, as the elves would be exiled to the clouds to await their reign.

On the last day, many of the elves went to see off their Urmannish comrades well, when their leader [[Xandril The Executioner|The Grandmaster in The Executioners mask]], reached for the [[High Priestess of Urur]], and they shared the beneath together, this was the first crack, and no one reigned.

#### [[Corruption of Urur]]
[[Urur]] was the metaphysical Embodiement of Creation, A spirit of Elemental Life, when the first crack broke in the Mirrors so to did one in [[Urur]]. It wasn't immediate, the Urmen of [[Moragitzu-Kesh]] and their Elven comrades journeyed further into the planes depths than before. As the space in the caverns down got tighter and smaller, [[Urur]] began to think coldly, there's enough space, just too many people. Then it thought, if I can make things live, maybe I can make them die, it tried concentrating on one of the Elves but it only looked livelier, when [[Urur]] tried to swing at the Elf, it had no physical form. Then after the group of men and elves camped for the night [[Urur]] whispered to his priestess, a woman of undying loyalty, to kill her partner in their bedroll that night [[Xandril The Executioner|The Grandmaster in The Executioners mask]],. When she did, the cracks got deeper, her partner may have escaped, but the blood that spilled stirred, in all of life. The rest of the Urmen turned on the Elves and even on each other. The blood of: lovers, neighbors, friends, family, all pooled on the ground, staining it, giving it flesh, and then making that flesh bleed, and again each time more putrid and violent. The surviving Elves fled to the portal that had got their ancestors there but it wouldn't open anymore, most died the only survivors where druids deep in the woods, and The most dedicated followers of the [[Raven Queen]] stayed by the portal. [[Xandril The Executioner|The Grandmaster in The Executioners mask]], stood by his [[Umbrachiko|Loyal Hound]] atop[[Temple of Umbrachiko rooms|The Fortress]], surrounded by graves of his people, as the doors around it sealed they went down, sealing the stairs to the roof behind them. As the Elves went up, The Urmen went down, and with them too did the blood

#### [[The Dawning]]

Soon after the First Treaty of Moragaitzu-Kesh the Urmen and elves all gone or hidden, there was an echo, and Arcane Energy surged through the world, reawakening the Priests of Archay, resting in the clouds, and getting the attention of the Oriqular Councilors who had been churning deep beneath the sea's for their sorceror king. 

At the same time something fell into the snarled mana wells , and when it surged, it grew and mutated, it became an egg, but at the same time a million, million dragons, but at the same time one with five heads 4 and no arms or legs. As the beast tried to hold that last form, the priests of Archay, and Oriqular Councilors gathered around. The beast said to the crowed, "I desire to be ordered, Bow to me, Stabalize me, free me of change and I will give you form again" 

Enochius saw this creatures wisdom and lowered his head, the rest of the priests followed. As the beast kept its shape, it and the priests of Archay began to reorder themselves, and this world, Enochius Became Mattatran, The First Archaic, Archaic of Scavengers, and Necromancy. Mattatran with new eyes saw through the wisdom in this beast, and saw the evil at its heart, a desire for domination and Tyranny, not Order and Peace. With a, "Apologies, my new lord" reached his hand into his new masters heart, and hurled it to the sky, where it flew through space, blackened with hate, hardened with Discipline, and with a fire deep inside, it flew, till something saw it, and it pierced the eye.
The Sorceror King however would bow to no one, and neither would his council, they returned to the ocean mad about their formlessness, but still able churn and rage, but unable to feel the pain they desired. Until something other than water began to bubble beneath the surface. [[Urur]] met the Sorceror king and his council, discussed the past, and debated the future, until they decided to enter a bargain, the oriqular council would make for [[Urur]] a plane of his own, an abyssal plane of blood and violence, and inhabiting it would make them act as his envoys across the planes. In exchange [[Urur]] would allow the council to feel the pain of his servants, the Sorceror King who normally would never make a decision without his council, tired of the numbness of nonexistance, extended a hand into the mass of blood, and he felt it, the blood, and when his arm ripped off, and the drowning, and so did all his councilors. When it was over the survivors were reformed into Daemogoths, the rest used for scraps added to the Sorceror King and his closest advisors making them Daemogoth Titans first among them. The former Sorceror King, now Ur-Abzu the beginning primordial.


#### [[Purification of the tainted blood, and rebirth of the Feywild]]

Years had passed since the world started to bleed, and it had since reached the surface, turning forests, and plains to deserts, and deserts into lakes and rivers of blood. The Lands it touched were twisting, becoming jagged, and hateful. But when a burst of magic from far away, a butterfly tried to remember what, had been here so long ago, and he eventually found a ragged old man sitting on a rock, the old man, one of the last of the Old Elven Druids, shadar Kai that had converted to [[Urur]]/nature worship, but left following his corruption. The old man ignored the butterflies, buzzing, so the butterfly saw the man, wanting to become like him so he could ask the man easier, he grew arms legs, a head and all the things on it, till he looked like a small naked bald man with butterfly wings. The old man did not react to the butterfly man. The butterfly man asked the old man, "What was here." and as the old man told the butterfly man of old tales, of valour and chivalry, and "so much green, so much life", they walked, and the Butterflyman imagined how it must have been. Then one day, he pulled the Oldman aside to show him something, a bush, they hadn't seen one in miles of walking, but the Oldman didn't notice what was so important till he went inside, he was in another plane full of life and green, laughter and joy. The Old man peaked his head back out, to see if this really was his old world come back, brought life through the butterfly mans imagination. When he looked outside and saw the green spreading from the bush, for the first time in a long time maybe ever he smiled.
