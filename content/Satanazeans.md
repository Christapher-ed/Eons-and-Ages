The original inhabitants of Septea, banished to [[The Satanazes]], Celto-Iberian Al-Andalusian Dinosaur riders, when their water elemental allies who had brought them to the opposing isles were banished by the first arch-bishop the water genasi and other mortals aligned with them were sent to [[The Satanazes]] the Island of Monsters. After making it for the first century or so they were constantly on the verge of extinction, but once they figured out how to ride, and work with the Dinosaurs they began to rebuild their civilization in the shadow of [[Septea]], not particularly interested in revenge, as they are happy with the new way of life they've made for themselves, they take great pride in their ability to use the islands natural hazards to never lose a home again.
