Short History of the [[Elemental Shift Engine]], alongside rules for it, an arcane machine that can cast a sort of limited planeshift that transports one vehicle its attached to and any passengers. 

Not used in most peoples daily lives, but revolutionary for our guild and society as a whole has been the Elemental Shift Engine. More, and more merchant, exploratory, and military vessels are being equipped with these, , and with a [[Planar compass]] to detect where the barriers weakest, they can travel between planes, to other material planes, Inner Planes, Nearer & Further outer ones and more.

The earliest Septean version, developed by Jeremius The Mapper, only could only shift through the plane of Water, which and without any control, causing him to fall out of a raincloud onto Arcaos. Long before an ancient Dwarven machine that was similar could shift through earth, but only from one fixed point to another. It wasn't until Jeremius's second engine based on crashed outer plane spelljammers he inspected after [[H Day]], that people could use one for all elemental planes, with limited control via numerous arcane safety measures. 

Since then new trade routes have excited merchants, given new meaning to cartographers, and and frightened the military. Merchants have been using it to take routes through other planes to trade both on other planes and on Inundatia through faster routes, smugglers and pirates have also made great use of it, and the Merchant ships equipped with them.

To Cartographers it has strengthened our drive to map the planes, all the new routes and tricks through them, and to the best of our ability document them. While the guild does not produce many Elemental engines, as the main supplier of Planar compasses, and patent holder for both, is able to negotiate deals for members to get their own private ones.

The Military of [[The Prince-Archbishopric of Septea]] under [[Prince-Archbishop Maximus IX]], had already been growing in number and strength turning [[The Humble Guard]] into a branch of The Septean Military, now has equipped their airships with Elemental Shift Engines. Supported by the new Septean Skyguard ensure defense of Septean Colonies and Trade routes.

The operation of Elemental Engines can be anywhere from straightforward to incredibely complicated, depending on the model. In the most basic sense a Elemental Shift Engine, uses elements in the engine to connect to ambient elemental energy (usually whatevers strongest) to teleport to that plane or through it to another. More complicated ones have more control, able to travel through elemental to outer and back in another part of the sea.
