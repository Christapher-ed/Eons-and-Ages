Honestly, mostly just use the D&D House Style guide but don't sweat the legalese/setting specific stuff
https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/book/ed17/frontmatter/toc.html

D&D House Style Guide reccomends:
Section 5.250
Chapter 6
Chapter 7
Chapter 9
(For Copy Editors:) Section 2.77

## Can Skip in House Style Guide:
### Titles and Trademarks
### Texts about the D&D Setting
### High Fantasy (mostly)
More High Fantasy than low, mostly high magic, with increasing elements of clock punk, and other Fantasy Sub-Genres. If I have to label it anything though I'd want to put it in Weird Fiction, or Weird Fantasy
# Obsidian specific stuff
