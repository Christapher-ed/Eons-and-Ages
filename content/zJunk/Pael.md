to be a good champion

needs to withstand a lot of souls in him

have a strong sense of identity to keep control

Pael is the reincarnation of Xandril, who is the reincarnation of The Revanchist, The son of The Raven Queen and The Night King, who vowed vengeance on The Raven Queen when she killed The Night King
each incarnatian was/is destined to fulfill the raven queens role in her original Eon, bringing the memory of past Eons to the next.

When the final anti party fight happens: 
1. Have Pael realize, what was his and his brothers souls, is not theirs anymore, twisted to the point where, if he takes it back he might even be more broken
2. talk to him through a memory of Honin, about the [[Raven Queen]], memories, mystery, duty, and the true purpose of it all
3. Have Pael think about his friends and family, the memories he has left, the ones he can make and share in the future, if He says yes go to step 4 if not wis save or die
4. Flood of memories first hist that he lost, then all his brothers, then all the other paladins that were with him, then Xandrils where he realizes his true purpose, to absorb all the worlds memories, so if and when it ends, he can restore it
5. If Pael accepts flood of all the worlds memories enters Pael
6. [[Raven Queen]] asks, clearer than ever if Regina's the one who took his soul, and reach out of his chest and snaps her neck
