On a slab in Ur-Arcavian with the symbol of the Church of The Cycle

- Dark mirrors mirror dark mirrors
- When the Elder Dragons are silent
- When a Sorcerer King is crowned
- When the Echo of The Oldest Oldest walks twice
- The, Gurmakata souls gather
- The Sun will eat the moon
- The Stars become a dull red
- Chaos Reigns

Other side:

- Dark mirrors mirror dark mirrors
- When the Elder Dragons speak with new voices
- When a Tyrant of Chaos is crowned
- When the Oldest Oldest is gone and forgotten
- The, Gurmakata souls gather
- The Moon will become a sun
- The Stars become a dull red
- Order Prevails

Gurmakata - is literally "hero character" in Ur-Arcavian (shitty Sumerian) more about the narrative importance than quality of morality
