Art is magic, and the only way to prove it is by casting spells. Mesmerizing people into beautiful and terrible worlds.

# Setting

High Fantasy, Spell jammers are common in outer planes, and increasingly common on the material (as of 3E 5A 30)
Tech as advanced as Ironclad ships, and firearms (around 3E 5A 10)
Hero, Elemental, Environmental gods more powerful/influential. (Last two especially on Innundatia)
Centered on mortals, both cosmologically, and narratively.
Tie magic to "real life" magic and its relationship to art, but also science (doubly for artificers)

# Tone

No Good & Evil , just greater and lesser evils.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Be a sadist, see what players/characters are made of

# Themes

- Identity
- Corruption
- Redemption

# Vonnegut Writing Advice

https://lithub.com/kurt-vonneguts-greatest-writing-advice/

## List

- **Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.  

- **Give the reader at least one character he or she can root for.  

- **Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.  

- **Every sentence must do one of two things—reveal character or advance the action.

- **Start as close to the end as possible.  

- **Be a sadist. No matter how sweet and innocent your leading characters, make awful things happen to them—in order that the reader may see what they are made of. 

- **Write to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your story will get pneumonia.  

- **Give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. To heck with suspense. Readers should have such complete understanding of what is going on, where and why, that they could finish the story themselves, should cockroaches eat the last few pages.

### On not selling anything:

I used to teach a writer’s workshop at the University of Iowa back in the 1960s, and I would say at the start of every semester, “The role model for this course is Vincent van Gogh—who sold two paintings to his brother.” (Laughs.) I just sit and wait to see what’s inside me, and that’s the case for writing or for drawing, and then out it comes. There are times when nothing comes. James Brooks, the fine abstract-expressionist, I asked him what painting was like for him, and he said, “I put the first stroke on the canvas and then the canvas has to do half the work.” That’s how serious painters are. They’re waiting for the canvas to do half the work. (Laughs.) Come on. Wake up. (From _The Last Interview_)

### On the value of writing:

If you want to really hurt your parents, and you don’t have the nerve to be gay, the least you can do is go into the arts. I’m not kidding. The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possible can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something. (From _A Man Without a Country_)

### On the theory of teaching creative writing:

I don’t have the will to teach anymore. I only know the theory… It was stated by Paul Engle—the founder of the Writers Workshop at Iowa. He told me that, if the workshop ever got a building of its own, these words should be inscribed over the entrance: “Don’t take it all so seriously.” (From “an interview conducted with himself, by himself,” for _[The Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3605/kurt-vonnegut-the-art-of-fiction-no-64-kurt-vonnegut)_)
