In Septea, and its colonies non worshippers of the seven virtues must pay a fixed tax to the church, if they cannot pay they will be taken into the care of the bishopric of charity until such a time they can or they convert. Members of the church are only expected to contribute to the church tithe, while not mandatory priests will tell the virtues, and people will generally ostracize you, a certain percentage of the tithe payers wealth is expected, those who exceed it are cherished, unless they gloat too much, those who don't meet that percentage are viewed poorly.
