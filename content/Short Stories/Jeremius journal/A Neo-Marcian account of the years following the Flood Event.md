I was born 40 years after our mountains became islands, after we became all thats left of Marcia. I never got to see the rolling mountains of our forefathers and no one ever may again, that is why I record all I know of what our land was, who our people were, so that we may preserve it. 60 years have passed since my birth making it 100 years since our islands were last peaks, recent enough many of the eldest when I was born remembered it well telling me of the grand Empire of Marcia spreading across the land and how we are all that remains. The Elders would tell me of our military might, our civic structure, how we were just a small village at the border with the sky. The Elders did not seem to think that glory could be reachieved, but I do in the years since then our Islands have swelled, our sailing skills have become masterful. If we wanted we could restore our Empire across its former sky.
