“Phillipip Ironvein!” 

A gruff dwarf woman shouted at a scrawny gnome with rust colored veins and rough skin, who stepped up struggling not to break the military posture, “You’re in charge of battening the top bow hatch on Boatswain Gravs command.” Phillipip gulped. That was the biggest hole in the ship, and the command after battening the hatches will be to dive. If every hole is not sealed the whole ship will flood.

Phillipip gave a salute and headed off past thousands of mustered Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, and Earth Elementals, in a towering Atrium; the Clanships War District. Phillipip couldn’t miss a beat, using every shortcut he knew on this millenia-old ship to get to the top entrance. He got there just as a command blared through the stone intercom of the clan ship, “Batten down the hatches!Prepare to enter the Plane of Water!” blared Boatswain Gravs voice.

The stone doors of the Clanship slid shut at Phillipip’s command, cutting a wave in half that knocked him against the wall. After getting out of his dazed state, soaking from the wave, Phillipip rushed to the newly shut doors and began to use every ounce of his magic to weld the stone shut. Using built in handholds of intricate design to reach the highest points, just as he seals the last bit, a wave knocks the ship back,throwing Phillipip against the back wall again harder.

Phillipip woke up beaten and bruised. It looked like the entrance flooded, but not more than their usual drainage system could handle. After climbing back up he saw it: outside in front of the horizon curling up into the sky was a huge waterfall, completely circular and descending near infinitely. Before he could process what was happening the ship lurched forward into the pit, shoving Phillipips face into the door, forcing him to peer at the endless pit surrounded by rushing water. The tremendous force kept Phillipip pressed against this hole until he mustered the strength to roll over, and seal it before passing out.
