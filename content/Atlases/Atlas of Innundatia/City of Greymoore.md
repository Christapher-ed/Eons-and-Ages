# Timeline

**YEARS ARE APPROXAMITE** 

**Year 780**
Septean refugees from the expansion of [[The Neo-Marcian Empire]], joined by refugees of would be vassal states settled in Greymoore, named for the grey stone of the cliffs, settled on the coast where there was plentiful fish. The group had a makeshift diarchy between the Bishop and the most influential Meisters, eventually forming a dual mayor position, one elected by the guilds, one appointed by the Governor-Bishop of Paldreia based around. The Seat of Government for these Mayors had to exist in a neutral ground so they built the "House of The Virtuous", and the surrounding district The Balcony of The Virtuous Few, and shunned non church or guild members becoming "The Virtuous", everyone else was pushed to the margins, founding their own "Vicious Hall" and likewise naming themselves after their headquarters as "The Vicious"
**Year 802**
Sea Kobolds, with magical giant sea turtles used for: ballasts, transport, land, farm labor, and more join. The Kobolds join The Vicious except for very few who convert or manage to obtain a guild apprenticeship. With the Influx of new people Chelonia is founded near the beach.
**Year 852**
Virtuous use archaic guild law, and the fact that one of the Kobolds they gave a guild apprenticeship to was a major chief to claim the sea turtles as their property, allowing a limited amount more kobolds join for their expertise. Liminus Pass founded to connect the upper and lower parts of the city
**Year 843**
The Virtuous now connected to the bay, build Passgate to help maintain the flow of recourses from the bay to the guild manufactories and church tithes, as well as keep riffraff out. To support the administrative, and defensive aspects of Passgate, Barracks Keep was founded as a new district.
**Year 899**
Bishop Glimbo Brambledew, a kind halfling who truly believed in the importance of the Virtue of Charity was to be appointed new Mayor-Bishop of Greymoore but the families who had traditionally held the role fought it with some members of the guilds due to Glimbos sympathies towards outsiders, by trying in vain to stall his appointment. After guiding a group of priests and members of the medical guilds to build a Vindicates Hospital (also known as Saint Glimbos Hospital) Glimbo was shot with a poison arrow by a member of the Alchemists guild, who tried and executed the assassin, The Prince Archbishop would later declare Glimbo a martyr, and saint of charity. More expansion in the bay, particularly in fishing, and sea turtle husbandry, led to the Tortrock Isle becoming an official district.
**Year 922**
Near the woods a program to promote hunting began, to supplement the fish for the growing city. Around the same time Jautri Pier, a small oceanside amusement park was built. As these were built Barracks Keep, and its logistical, and defensive needs grew, resulting in a line of  watchtowers surrounding Barracks Keep, and along the cliffs flanking Passwall.
**Year 940**
A massive landslide destroys most of the Balcony of The Virtuous Few, moving the cliffside to the back yard of the House of the Virtuous. To replace the Balcony of The Virtuous few as the central district, Churchyard was founded, and many residents from the old district moved and set up there.
**Year 960**
The Vindicates, far from their fringe origins, begin acting as a check on the Virtuous, using their own influence in the church and guilds to investigate the virtuous. After realizing their charity missions to the destitute of the vicious were receiving less and less resources, the Vindicates got records from the Governor-Bishopric checking them against their own realized the virtuous had been skimming from the top, the vindicates and the virtuous worked together to publish as much about the event as possible, revealing the virtuous to be tainted by greed.
**Year 980**
Economic instability causes Jauri Pier to be unprofitable, but since no one wants to pay to remove everything sits abandoned. The Peoples Balcony is founded, and the upper city is no longer forbidden to The Vicious
**Year 1002**
Trying to regain power, merchants of the Virtuous make risky trades, trying to get higher prices for goods from Greymoore backfired when after accidently offending an influential member of the Water Baron of Eltsens court, the barony called for an embargo on clean water to Greymoore, from any Shallows Gnomes. The Merchants caved once a mob destroyed one of their villas, and people were dying of Dehydration, they went into immense debt to buy from a water tanker the gnomes had parked in the bay at an extremely unfair price. A small enclave of Shallows Gnomes set up around Tortrock Isle to make sure the city has a constant supply of fresh water (and is a constant supply of money) shallows gnomes aren't unambitious, many of the new settlers identify less with the Vicious and see themselves more as "temporarily embarrassed Barons"
**Year 1050**
Greymoore Architects Guildhall rises to prominence for innovative building techniques involving magic sea turtle shells.
**Year 1081**
