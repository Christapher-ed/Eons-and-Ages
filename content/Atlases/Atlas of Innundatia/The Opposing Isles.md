An Archipelagio in constant conflict. Dominated by the Isle of Seven Cities: [[Septea]] , one of the largest islands in the world (slightly smaller than portugal), and extremely cosmopolitan. Despite their near constant conflict with the [[The Satanazes]], a mysterious island that according to [[The Church of the Virtues]] is filled entirely with monsters, they are able to dominate the burgeoning global trade, and culture.
