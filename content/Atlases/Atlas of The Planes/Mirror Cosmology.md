Mirror Cosmology is a way of mapping the cosmos popular with interplanar travelers, and on the material plane of [[Arcaos]], also known as the paired prism. The theory of it was developed over a series of ages on [[Arcaos]], until perfected by [[Jeremius the Mapper]] when he discovered how to map the planes accurately. Instead of distinguishing upper and lower, which was really meaningless to navigation, he distinguished between nearer and further. Before the innovations of Jeremius, attempts at transport to the planes of, Baator, Mount Celestia, The Abyss, and Arborea. Using a make shift charting tool using magic of each plane/element he navigated a crew from his homeport in [[Atlases/Atlas of Innundatia/The Opposing Isles]] through a whirlpool to a lake on Mount Celestia, by routing it through Elysium, had to use an icebreaker ship.

The core principle of the mirror cosmology is the elemental lasers that hold it all together, they go through the prism of the material world, and connect all others.

#### Judicia

Includes what other models call Acheron, Arcadia, and Mt Celestia

#### Baator

Another name for Hell, 

#### Arborea

Also known as Valorea 

Includes what other models call The Beastlands, and Ysgard, the natural idyll to Elysiums Cosmopolitan Idyll

Maybe something with being Olympus+Ysgard The most "gody" of outer planes?
