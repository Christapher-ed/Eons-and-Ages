Paldreia is a continent dominated by The Neo Marcian Empire, from their Archipalaegio in the north they are able to maintain a system of tributaries on the continent and further abroad. There's also a small Anarchic Thallasocracy, supplied by and allied with [[Satanazean Beastlords]].Though considered unimportant due to relative unprofitability by the septeans, they have colonies in Paldriea but due to endless raiding on shipping, and neglect from Septea they retain a lot of autonomy.
